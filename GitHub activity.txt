Part A - Github
---------------

1. Work with the team members of your Group Project

2. Each member creates a GitHub account

3. Choose one GitHub account where you will create the main repository to save your project (here alsdfgjkag)

4. Create a repository for your Group Project, e.g.
name: our_project
Description: "The remote repository of our Group Project for CPS"
Choose 'Public' and click 'Create Repository'.

5. Add collaborators:
Under your repository >> Settings >> Access >> 
Collaborators >> Add people (using their alias or email address) and follow the instructions

6. Check your emails and access the invitation

7. Each member adds one file to introduce themselves
Click on 'creating a new file' (for empty repo) or 'Add file' followed by 'Create new file' (for non-empty repo)
name: membername
content: #this is membername
Click on commit changes
commit's message: "Create membername intro file"

8. Check that all members can see and read everyone's intro file

9. Upload your README.pdf file (only once =)
Upload a file: Code >> Add a file >> Upload files
Choose file, then Commit. Example of commit message: "The main description of our group project"

10. Check that all members can see and read everyone's intro file

11. Before leaving, each team member will create a personal access token. These personal access tokens replace passwords for authentication to GitHub using Git command line.

* In the upper right corner: User icon >> Settings
* On the left panel: Developer settings (bottom of list) >> Personal access tokens >> Tokens (classics)
* Generate new token (classic)
* Note: "personal_access_token_membername"
* Click the repo checkbox under Select scopes section
